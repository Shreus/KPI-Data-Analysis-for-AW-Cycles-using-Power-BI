# KPI-Data-Analysis-for-AW-Cycles-using-Power-BI

This report is designed for AW_Cycles which is a global manufacturing company. The Company want us to design and deliver an end-to-end business intelligence solution - from scratch!

I have created a way to track KPI's (Sales, Revenue, Profit, Returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends and forecasts and identify high-value customers.

Objectives completed:
- Connected and transformed the raw data
- Built a relational data model
- Created new calculated columns and DAX measures
- Designed an interactive report to analyze and visualize the data
